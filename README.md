**Why this project was created**<br/>
To better share and improve M360 source code (HTML, CSS, JS) in native format, with version control

**How this rapid prototype was "created"**<br/>
1) Ignore http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html<br/>
2) Browse http://semantic-ui.com/kitchen-sink.html<br/>
3) Save Page As "Web page, complete", as "model.html"<br/>
4) Change Sidebar, Menu, Masthead, and Footer<br/>
5) Host on Github and Add Collaborators<br/>
6) Embed branding and driving philosophy

**Restrictions on creation**<br/>
1) Only HTML, CSS, JS and Github<br/>
2) No Content Management System<br/>
3) No Salesforce Community

**Why such restrictions?**<br/>
We can't assume that all CX (UX+FE) know how to use CLI tools and open source Content Management Systems; SF Community is not free

**Why not Confluence?**<br/>
1) No version control<br/>
2) No access to CSS<br/>
3) WYSIWYG vs Sublime Text 3 (with Mavensmate)

**Why Semantic UI? Why not Bootstrap or Foundation?**<br/>
Exigiency. Semantic UI's documentation structure, its sidebar and built-in page tabs, are just plain smarter... and prettier!<br/>

**Does this mean that all our projects must now use Semantic UI?**<br/>
Nope, just this project

**How could this project be used for other things?**<br/>
For presentation, sharing, and improvement of all other M360 digital products and deliverables, beyond the WYSIWYG-presentation capabilities of Confluence

**To be done, once approved as an official open source, M360 CX Project**<br/>
Prune the head by validating the need for single style or script<br/>
Create pages using the model; 25+ possibilities for content have been identified in the sidebar, so create and produce according to team prioritization<br/>
Implement http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html as needed
