Why this project was created
To better share and improve M360 source code (HTML, CSS, JS) in native format, with version control

How this rapid prototype was "created"
1) Ignore http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html
2) Browse http://semantic-ui.com/kitchen-sink.html
3) Save Page As "Web page, complete", as "model.html"
4) Change Sidebar, Menu, Masthead, and Footer
5) Host on Github and Add Collaborators

Restrictions on creation
1) Only HTML, CSS, JS and Github
2) No Content Management System
3) No Salesforce Community

Why such restrictions?
We can't assume that all CX (UX+FE) know how to use CLI tools and open source Content Management Systems; SF Community is not free

Why not Confluence?
1) No version control
2) No access to CSS
3) WYSIWYG vs Sublime Text 3 (with Mavensmate)

Why Semantic UI? Why not Bootstrap or Foundation?
1) Exigiency. Semantic UI's documentation structure, its sidebar and tabs, are easier to use
2) <div class="col-lg-4"> vs <div class="column">

Does this mean that all our projects must now use Semantic UI?
Nope, just this project


How this project could be further applied
For presentation, sharing, and improvement of all other M360 digital products and deliverables, beyond the WYSIWYG-presentation capabilities of Confluence






To be done, once approved as an official open source, M360 CX Project
