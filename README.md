Why this project was created<br/>
To better share and improve M360 source code (HTML, CSS, JS) in native format, with version control

How this rapid prototype was "created"<br/>
1) Ignore http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html<br/>
2) Browse http://semantic-ui.com/kitchen-sink.html<br/>
3) Save Page As "Web page, complete", as "model.html"<br/>
4) Change Sidebar, Menu, Masthead, and Footer<br/>
5) Host on Github and Add Collaborators

Restrictions on creation<br/>
1) Only HTML, CSS, JS and Github<br/>
2) No Content Management System<br/>
3) No Salesforce Community<br/>

Why such restrictions?<br/>
We can't assume that all CX (UX+FE) know how to use CLI tools and open source Content Management Systems; SF Community is not free

Why not Confluence?<br/>
1) No version control<br/>
2) No access to CSS<br/>
3) WYSIWYG vs Sublime Text 3 (with Mavensmate)

Why Semantic UI? Why not Bootstrap or Foundation?<br/>
1) Exigiency. Semantic UI's documentation structure, its sidebar and tabs, are easier to use<br/>
2) <div class="col-lg-4"> vs <div class="column"><br/>

Does this mean that all our projects must now use Semantic UI?<br/>
Nope, just this project


How this project could be further applied<br/>
For presentation, sharing, and improvement of all other M360 digital products and deliverables, beyond the WYSIWYG-presentation capabilities of Confluence






To be done, once approved as an official open source, M360 CX Project<br/>
1) Prune <head>
