**URL to view and evaluate this rapid prototype, through Raw Git**<br/>
https://rawgit.com/ncuano/m360uxlibrary/master/model-interior.html


**Why this project was created**<br/>
To better recycle, share, and improve digital products and deliverables,<br/>
especially source code (HTML, CSS, JS) in native format, with version control

**How this rapid prototype was "created" and changed**<br/>
1) Ignore http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html<br/>
2) Browse http://semantic-ui.com/kitchen-sink.html<br/>
3) Save Page As "Web page, complete", as "model.html"<br/>
4) Prune the Head by deleting code irrelevant for our use<br/>
5) Write and Design Sidebar, Menu, Masthead, and Footer<br/>
6) Version Control with Github and Add Collaborators<br/>
7) Create and Embed Branding and Driving Philosophy

**Restrictions on proto-creation**<br/>
1) Only HTML, CSS, JS and Github<br/>
2) No Content Management System<br/>
3) No M360 Salesforce Community

**Why such restrictions?**<br/>
We can't assume that everyone knows how to use CLI tools and open source Content Management Systems; SF Community is not free. But it SHOULD be safe to assume that everyone has a working-to-intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, and Git/hub

**Why not Confluence?**<br/>
1) No version control<br/>
2) No access to CSS and Javascript<br/>
3) WYSIWYG vs Sublime Text 3 (with Mavensmate)

**Why Semantic UI? Why not Bootstrap or Foundation?**<br/>
Exigiency. The ideal model for upcycling is already pre-made. Semantic UI's documentation structure, its sidebar and built-in page tabs, are just plain smarter... and prettier! 

**Does this mean that all our projects must now use Semantic UI?**<br/>
Nope, just this project, and even that may change, depending on adoption and actual usage

**How could this project be used for other things?**<br/>
For presentation, sharing, and improvement of all other M360 digital products and deliverables, especially if beyond the capabilities of Confluence

**To be done, once approved as an official M360-CX Project**<br/>
1) Prune the head further by validating the need for every single style or script<br/>
2) Create pages using the model; 25+ possibilities for content have been identified in its sidebar, so create and produce according to team prioritization, using the sidebar as starting point for plotting content production then naming files (e.g. personas.html, if it's a page on User Research / Personas) and updating links to them accordingly<br/>
3) Implement http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html as needed
